          "body": "I’m what people call a “kitchen sink” chef. \n\nEvidently, I have the (somewhat rare) ability to take stock of whatever is in the pantry or refrigerator at any given moment and throw together a sensible meal. Over the past few months, I’ve realized just how well this gastronomical hack transfers to my day job: startup marketing. \n\nMost modern marketing recipes pull from the same ingredient list: a heavy dose of digital, a bracing amount of social, a dash of paid advertising, and some events on the side (let’s not forget to smother a bunch of quasi-targeted emails on top for good measure). \n\nWhile each company is largely tapping into the same ingredients list, it’s the creativity, execution, and presentation that determines if users see fast food, instagram worthy fine dining, or something else entirely. Nothing like a disappointing meal at a fancy steak house, right?\n\n## Building a meal together\n\nI spent the last few weeks creating our “go to market” (GTM) plan for 2026. While we can’t taste the final product in advance, we did our best to take stock of the ingredients at hand and decide what kind of marketing magic we could create. \n\nWhat made this effort particularly challenging for me is the early stage of our company. While our journey went public in November when [Datum exited stealth mode](https://www.datum.net/blog/internet-superpowers-for-every-builder/), we hit the streets with a product waitlist. It was an exciting moment, but nothing screams “we’re still building” more than a waitlist. In other words, please take your seat and a waiter will be with you shortly!\n\nSurprisingly, I’ve really enjoyed building a GTM plan for a product that’s still developing. Besides it being quite literally in the name “_go to_ market”, the early stage of our product requires everyone to work as a team. While my engineering, design, and infrastructure colleagues create our product one line, pixel, PoP and commit at a time, my only choice is to put on an apron and get my hands dirty. From rewriting the menu on the chalkboard as the menu changes and setting the tables, to making sure we’re attracting our next star chef, it’s all part of the experience we’re developed for our users and customers. \n\n## Working in an open kitchen\n\nThis chaotic (but also creative and gratifying) process has reframed how I think about marketing. Add in the fact that Datum is organized around working fully in the open and it’s clear that I’ve had to examine some uncomfortable truths about how I operate.\n\nAs an ex-agency gal who was raised on “grand reveal” presentations, working at a [truly “open” company](https://www.datum.net/handbook/about/strategy/) has challenged me to my core. Putting my earliest work and thinking in a public, [documented space like GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/datum-cloud/projects/34) goes against my instincts. And a big part of that is because I don’t want to look stupid.\n\nAlthough I’ve been deeply invested in learning the inner workings of the internet for the better part of six years, I often feel out of my depth. Like landing in a foreign country without a translator, digital infrastructure and networking can make even the most savvy marketer feel insecure. It’s because of this insecurity that I tend to keep my feedback loops small: I share my presentations and writing with my manager (thanks for creating a safe space!) and worry about sharing things _too early_ in case they’re not right. \n\nBecause then I’ll be found out for the imposter I am, right? Wrong! And it’s only in the last few weeks (while building this year’s GTM plan) that I’ve realized how my own journey these last few months is a great example of what we need more of in 2026.\n\n## How imperfections fuel authenticity\n\nAs Mark LaRossa (one of the operating partners at Amplify, a Datum investor) wrote recently, the AI era has ushered in a new wave [celebrating grit and imperfection](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mlarosa_my-predictions-for-this-year-founders-and-activity-7414344365516500992-yGSU/?utm_source=share\\&utm_medium=member_ios\\&rcm=ACoAAACPBsQBtbnIyZzW_FQ3jydF0PRywpDj2ZA). Initially, I read Mark’s post and immediately I bemoaned the loss of carefully curated creative work. And I know I’m not alone. \n\nI’ve seen similar reactions from friends and creative industry colleagues who are watching AI challenge overnight the talents (and careers) they’ve carefully crafted over the years. For many creatives, their work is an extension of themselves, and AI is threatening the core of their value with pixel-perfect, effortless-created words, images, memes, podcasts, and videos.\n\nOr is it? Thankfully, I’ve come through the other side and have a different take. There is, in fact, beauty in imperfection. It’s what makes us human. \n\nIn pottery, the Japanese have a unique way of repairing broken ceramics: kintsugi. Shattered ceramic ware is stitched back together with a powdered gold or silver, a method that serves to celebrate resilience and imperfection. \n\nHere’s the thing: AI is noisy. Between the AI-generated LinkedIn posts to the AI-driven ads, blog posts, cold emails, and cover letters, it’s clear that creating stuff isn’t a problem. But creating experiences that are meaningful, or compelling, or honest…that takes a different approach. \n\nOr to quote James Halliday in _Ready Player One_:\n\n> As terrifying and painful as reality can be, it's also the only place where you can get a decent meal. Because, reality... is real.\n\n**So, what’s on the menu at Datum?** It’s still a work in progress, but the mix is starting to feel right. We’re laser focused on the awareness and activation phases of our flywheel, and here’s what it looks like:\n\n- Core / Baseline (70% of our time, energy and money)\n\n  - Website \n\n  - Personal brands\n\n  - Monthly product loops\n\n  - Product assets\n\n  - Events\n\n  - AEO / SEO\n\n  - Tech stack + Milo \n\n- Rock Star Moves (30% of our time, energy and money)\n\n  - Creative drops\n\n  - Big moments\n\n  - PR / AR\n\nThe ingredient that you’ll taste throughout all of our marketing efforts in 2026 will be an authentic, human one. It’ll be messy, far from perfect, but it will be honest and genuine. \n\n- We will take the time to film our videos with actual humans in front of the camera (because trust is built on knowing the faces behind the tech you’re using). \n\n- We will take the time to write our own blog posts, changelogs, newsletters, and website copy (because clarity of thought is created in the struggle of the written word).   \n\n- We will continue to host our monthly community huddles (because we’re committed to sharing our journey, our learnings, and our setbacks, even if things aren’t “perfectly” ready for prime time). \n\nThis year is likely not the year to expect a loud bang from us here at Datum. You can, however, expect a quiet yet steady, and reliable rhythm for product release communications, an ongoing dialogue with our executive team, and in-person less than perfect moments to connect with our community. \n\nAnd we hope you’ll find it delicious."

          "body": "Over the last few years, a new wave of digital service providers (we like to call them alt clouds) have emerged. Think Supabase, Vercel, Resend, Loveable and many others. These specialized clouds abstract gnarly infra and provide clean, productized APIs. \n\nMost startups still reach for a familiar web stack—Laravel/Gin/Django plus an Object Relational Mapping (ORM)—and then bolt on billing, auth, notifications, support tooling, and sales ops. It ships, but it quietly becomes a bespoke back office that no one really budgeted to maintain. \n\nFast forward a few million users and entropy can take place: features slow down, integration glue ages badly, and engineers spend cycles keeping the administrative plumbing alive instead of evolving the product customers love. \n\nWe think there is a better way.\n\n\n## A control plane mindset\n\nI’ve been deep in Kubernetes since 2016 (yes, “Kubernetes the Hard Way” deep!), working to really understand how all the parts fit together. Early on, I developed an appreciation for the Kubernetes approach that introduced a modular infrastructure management platform for running containers and making API integrations easy.\n\nBy 2018 at StackPath (my previous company) we leaned into Operators back when the Operator SDK still had that new-car smell. We discovered how the control loop model could turn intent into reliable state. By treating APIs as resources and letting controllers reconcile, we increased our velocity and shipped sturdier software.\n\n_What clicked_: Kubernetes isn’t just a container scheduler. Its _true_ superpower is the control plane—an API server, a rich discovery surface, and a reconciliation engine that can be extended. Build your “platform APIs” as first-class resources and you inherit years of hard-won machinery.\n\n\n## Creature comforts you get “for free”\n\nWhen you model your platform as Kubernetes-style APIs, you pick up:\n\n- **API discovery & schemas** via the Discovery API and OpenAPI v3—clients know what exists and how to talk to it.  \n\n- **Declarative validation & policy** with CEL-powered ValidatingAdmissionPolicy (no external webhooks required if you don’t want them).  \n\n- **Event-driven reconciliation** (watches and controllers) instead of cron-polling spaghetti.  \n\n- **Extensibility** two ways: **CRDs** for simple schema-backed types and **API Aggregation** when you need full custom server behavior.  \n\n- **Authn/Authz that’s fully customizable** (OIDC, RBAC, Webhooks) with policy in the API.\n\n- **Audit logs** out of the box for who did what, when.  \n\nAdd controllers, define resources, and suddenly your “back office” looks like a platform.\n\n\n## The new frontier: Kubernetes as a generic control plane\n\nIn the last few years, the Kubernetes community made running a custom Kubernetes-style control plane far more approachable. A highlight is [KEP-4080](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/2a881c600fa7d135726d66a7ce54178819a102f7/keps/sig-api-machinery/4080-generic-controlplane/README.md), which proposes factoring out generic parts of kube-apiserver/kube-controller-manager into a reusable generic control plane library and sample binary. \n\nThe goal: keep the good stuff (RBAC, admission, CRDs, garbage collection, namespaces) without bundling the container-orchestration bits you may not need. That’s a big deal for service providers who want Kubernetes-grade APIs without carrying Kubelet/POD semantics.\n\nPractically, this means you can:\n\n- Stand up a Kubernetes-like API surface for your domain (quotas, organizations, projects, invoices, policies, workflows) using CRDs and/or aggregated APIs.\n\n- Keep using the ecosystem—kubectl, watches, admission, RBAC, audit, OpenAPI discovery—so platform engineers grok it immediately.\n\n- Compose controllers as reconcile loops, rather than bespoke daemons and cron pipelines.\n\nThis progress has led to a reusable, modular control plane for “Kubernetes-style” APIs that isn’t tied to scheduling containers.\n\n\n## The spicy bits: real-world challenges\n\nThere is no free lunch in life, remember? A provider-grade control plane still faces hard problems and trade-offs:\n\n- **Multi-tenancy & hierarchy.** You’ll want Organizations → Projects (maybe Folders) with inherited policy, identity, and quotas.\n\n- **Storage pressure on etcd.** etcd loves small keys and predictable churn; watch your object counts, sizes, and compaction. The practical database ceiling: \\~8 GiB unless you like pain.\n\n- **Search/filter/sort UX.** The API gives you label/field selectors and efficient watches; heavy ad-hoc queries want secondary indexes or a sidecar indexer (ClickHouse/Elastic/etc.) so you don’t turn the API server into a search engine.  \n\nThese are solvable, with clear limits and dedicated services where the core API shouldn’t bend.\n\nEven with these caveats, we think it’s better to augment the Kubernetes apiserver rather than rebuild your own control plane from scratch. In addition to the benefits mentioned above, you get a foundation that’s familiar to the engineers you want to hire and inherit a thriving ecosystem: Argo and Flux for GitOps, k9s for operator ergonomics, policies you can test, and tools that already “speak kube.”\n\n\n## So…what are we building at Datum?\n\nWith [our Milo project](https://github.com/datum-cloud/milo), we’re investing in a distributed, multi-tenant control plane that is designed specifically _for service providers_. By riding on Kubernetes DNA, we’re betting on the value of:\n\n- **APIs first**: Everything is a resource. “Organizations,” “Projects,” “Quotas,” “Entitlements,” “Workflows,” “Invoices,” “SupportCases”—each a typed object with OpenAPI, RBAC, and admission policies. Discovery and docs are automatic.\n\n- **Controllers over scripts**: Reconciliation loops watch desired state and nudge reality into place—across clouds, regions, and edges. When something drifts, your controller notices and corrects it.\n\n- **Audit as a first-class citizen**: Actions become durable, queryable events. Compliance and support stop being a scavenger hunt.\n\n- **Extension-ready**: Need a new subsystem? Add a CRD, wire an admission policy, ship a controller. Need a non-CRD API? Register an aggregated apiserver and keep the uniform surface. \n\nEven after plenty of scrapes and bruises over the last few months, we believe that extending Kubernetes as a generic control plane is superior to rolling our own. The momentum behind making the Kubernetes apiserver into reusable libraries to build generic control planes makes this path real, not hypothetical.\n\nSo if you’re tired of rebuilding the same back office at every startup, come build **platforms** instead—APIs with a spine, not duct tape. There will be a few dragons along the way (and maybe a quota misfire or two), but we expect the destination is worth it: a provider-grade, multi-tenant control plane that feels native, scales with your customers, and lets your team spend more time shipping features than babysitting glue code.\n\n[See you on GItHub](https://github.com/datum-cloud/)!"

          "body": "When people ask, I like to say that the most interesting thing about Datum isn’t what we’re building, but who we’re building it for: the next 1k clouds.\n\nOf course, this statement usually elicits a nervous chuckle, if not an actual laugh out loud. “1000 clouds? That’s crazy!” But once you align on a definition that embraces how modern developers build and operate software, it’s pretty easy to see how today’s ecosystem of specialized service providers can grow into the thousands. \n\nBetween database providers, GPU specialists, observability platforms, security services, and AI infrastructure—the specialized services ecosystem is already in the hundreds and growing fast.\n\nWho better to run elasticsearch than Elastic, to scale data warehouses than Snowflake, or to provide observability than Grafana? Who better to integrate Nvidia technology (silicon, networking, etc) than CoreWeave, or AMD technology than Tensorwave? Who better to solve gnarly authorization and identity problems than AuthZed or Clerk, and who would you trust more to orchestrate the data underneath your invoicing than Metronome or Amberflo?\n\nThis isn’t to say that anyone is moving beyond the hyperscale clouds. In fact, almost every Alt Cloud we know builds on top of these bedrock platforms, among others. Accelerated by the AI revolution, a new class of modern service providers are changing how we think about innovation, scaling services, and delivering value with software. \n\n## From Service Provider to Alt Cloud\n\nAt Datum, we hold a special place in our hearts for service providers, mainly because we’ve walked in those shoes for a long time. \n\nThe term “service provider” evolved from Adam Smith’s economic concepts of specialization in the _Wealth of Nations_ to a late 20th century definition around outsourced functions like IT, telecom, and later cloud services (CSPs). \n\nFor such a humble moniker, these providers offer services that underpin our digital world: the unspoken heroes that quite literally keep the lights on. These are the companies that people only seem to notice when there is an outage and things grind to a halt.\n\nIn the post cloud native world, it’s clear the circle of critical operators has expanded substantially. In addition to network service providers and cloud service providers, we’ve come to rely on an ecosystem of specialized providers that run our databases, our identity services, our security services, and of course a whole host of AI-specific services.\n\nEnter the Alt Clouds — a hip name we borrowed from David Linthicum to draw a circle around the new class of modern, purpose-built service providers. \n\n## Towards a shared definition, starting on GitHub\n\nEver since Jamie York (@ziadoz) created the very first list ([awesome-php](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php)) as a gist of \"awesome PHP libraries that are awesome\", the internet has been in love with these simple, curated artifacts. \n\nAs we explored the Alt Clouds ecosystem, it became obvious that we needed to start cataloguing these providers. We jotted down each one we could remember, organized the categories as best we could, and started to take suggestions.\n\nWe broadly define Alt Clouds as non-hyperscale providers delivering specialized infrastructure and related services. These “modern service providers” cater to specific workloads, compliance requirements, and developer needs — and because they are so focused, they can often do it in a way that is very compelling. From databases and GPUs, to metering, authorization, security, here’s how we think about it: \n1. If you provide value \"as a service\" directly on top of infra, you’re probably an Alt Cloud.\n2. If you go down, and your customers start an incident, you’re probably an Alt Cloud.\n3. If you have an SLA folks care about, you’re probably an Alt Cloud. \n4. If you offer public pricing, a usage model, and full automation, you’re an Alt Cloud.\n\nSome folks would raise their hand and say: isn’t this all just SaaS, but more grown up? It’s a fair point! Clearly, each of these attributes have their roots in SaaS, but the way in which developers and companies integrate these services has changed. It’s no longer ancillary to their business, it’s core, and yet they still want it run as a service.\n\n## Building Datum from a mission point of view\n\nOur mission to help 1k clouds thrive in the AI era germinated long before we built an [Awesome list](https://github.com/datum-cloud/awesome-alt-clouds) or put a definition to Alt Clouds. In fact, it started as a much simpler and humble ambition: to help connect others to their advantage.  \n\nThis is an idea that has animated me for well over a decade, and it inspired us to ask the question: how can more companies tap into the superpowers that hyperscalers have? And what would happen if they did?\n\nIn short, we think really good things happen. Not because the hyperscalers lose, but because new services can take root and create competition that makes us all better. Translating that mission into reality is a daily practice at Datum: from our commitment to working in the open and deep investments in [Milo](https://www.milo-os.com/), to our recent acquisition of [CloudValid](/blog/open-sourcing-domain-validation/). \n\n In fact, everything we do is inspired by a question: how can we help Alt Clouds thrive? If you fit our definition (or plan to in the future!) we hope you’ll [reach out](/contact/)."

          "body": "I’m excited to announce that Datum has acquired [CloudValid](https://cloudvalid.com/). Alongside the acquisition, Datum will open source CloudValid’s technology.\n\nI started CloudValid to solve a problem so many SaaS companies know well: it’s a pain to get users to successfully connect or validate ownership of their domains. It's a mundane requirement that creates outsized friction and leads to abandoned onboarding flows, frustrated users, lingering support tickets, and poorly executed features.\n\nWhether you're building a help desk, website builder, AI coding tool or adding enterprise features like single sign on (SSO) or organizational controls, domain verification shouldn't be a barrier to activation. With the coming wave of “SSL for everything” ([Chrome & HTTPS by default](https://security.googleblog.com/2025/10/https-by-default.html)) this is even more critical, as thousands of new platforms will need to implement custom SSL certificates based on customer domain names. \n\nHappily, CloudValid's technology removes this toil. As part of Datum, we’re thrilled to build upon our existing solution and help every builder be able to incorporate seamless domain validation into their apps.\n\n\n## It’s true, domain setup breaks onboarding\n\nCustom domain support is table-stakes for modern SaaS applications. Users expect to white-label their experience, send emails from their own domains, and host content under their brand with confidence. But the technical reality that end users go through is anything but simple: DNS record configuration, verification workflows, provider detection, and SSL certificate management.\n\nWith this complexity, end users often fail to properly validate their domains. The result? Support tickets pile up, users get stuck, and activation rates suffer. If that wasn’t enough, let’s not forget about the engineering teams that spend valuable cycles building and maintaining domain verification infrastructure instead of focusing on their core product.\n\nSome proprietary solutions do exist for domain validation, but we believe an open approach is better suited for what’s ahead: billions of autonomous agents, a massive increase in SSL / TLS connections, and enterprise features that combine DNS, domains and certificates together. \n\nDomains and DNS are foundational building blocks of the internet. We think that for the internet to thrive in this next wave, every builder should have programmatic access to these building blocks. It makes sense for today, but also for the fast-paced agentic world of tomorrow. \n\nIt’s why we’ve decided to open source CloudValid under an AGPL v3 licensing model.  Here’s what we’re aiming to unlock to the developer and builder community:\n\n- **Freedom from vendor lock-in:** Build domain verification into your product without expensive lock-in through licensing fees or SaaS dependencies\n\n- **Transparency and trust:** Audit the code, understand exactly how domain verification works, and customize and contribute enhancements you want to see\n\n- **Community-driven innovation:** Contribute ideas, improvements, add support for new DNS providers, and solve edge cases together\n\nThis isn't about cost, it's about philosophy. Datum’s goal as a company is to help 1,000 clouds thrive in the AI era – and to do so, we believe that essential internet infrastructure should be open, accessible, and community-governed. \n\n\n### What CloudValid brings to Datum\n\nOver the next few months, CloudValid's technology will be integrated into Datum's open source project and become available via Datum Cloud. We're integrating across multiple areas:\n\n- **Authoritative DNS:** Streamlined zone management and record automation that reduces manual configuration and human error.\n\n- **Automated Domain Registration:** End-to-end workflows that guide users from domain search to successful connection, with built-in verification at every step.\n\n- **Integrated Domain + Proxy Workflows:** Seamless connection between domain configuration and traffic routing, essential for modern application delivery.\n\n- **SSL for SaaS:** Integrated global Proxy and domain + certificate management built specifically for SaaS and other multi-tenant providers.\n\n- **Email Authentication:** The major email inbox providers, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google, are now jointly requiring senders to pass DMARC checks, which is email authentication that relies on certain DNS records to exist.\n\nFor Datum Cloud users (especially SaaS platforms and alternative cloud providers) this means faster user activation, reduced support burden, and a more professional onboarding experience out of the box. And for next-wave builders, it means they can start to imagine new ways of building services that include custom domains as a default part of their experiences.\n\n\n### Getting involved\n\nEvery internet application begins the same way: with a domain name and DNS configuration. With CloudValid joining Datum, we're making that first step radically simpler—and radically more open.\n\nWhether you're a solo developer launching your first SaaS product or an enterprise team serving millions of users, you'll have access to the same battle-tested domain verification tools that power leading platforms.\n\n**Want to get involved?** [Reach out to me on Discord](https://link.datum.net/discord) and let’s chat about your pain points,  desires or rants on Domains and DNS. We’re working closely with customers as we launch our [Provider tier](/pricing/) and I’d love to get your ideas!"

          "body": "At some point in building a product, speed alone stops being the advantage. You can move fast, but without shared structure, you don’t move together. And if you don’t move together, the experience shows it - small inconsistencies, tiny misalignments, micro-decisions that add up to friction for users and slowdowns for the team.\n\nOlli is how we solved that.\n\nIt’s a custom design system built inside Figma, but more importantly, it’s a philosophy: that the best user experiences, the ones that feel coherent, thoughtful, and effortless, come from a foundation that supports creativity without constraining it. A foundation that makes it easier to build, explore, and iterate at high speed without sacrificing quality.\n\nOlli sits quietly underneath everything we design. Our users won’t see it, but they’ll feel its effects in every interaction. And our team feels it too - in the clarity it brings, the time it saves, and the freedom it gives us to focus on solving the right problems, not wrestling with the basics.\n\n![Our Olli mascot!](/uploads/blog/meet-olli-img-1.png)\n\n\n## Why Olli exists\n### 1. To raise the quality of the user experience\n\nSustained design quality requires more than good intentions.\n\nIdeally typography, spacing, scale, motion, and even interaction principles must be unified in a systemic manner - not intermittently corrected by individuals working late to align the details.\n\nOlli gives us that. It provides structure, coherence, and guardrails that help every designer make good decisions quickly. But crucially, it doesn’t dictate the outcome.\n\nIt makes quality easier, not narrower.\n\n### 2. To help us ship faster, together\n\nSpeed isn’t a product of working harder; it’s a product of removing drag.\n\nWith Olli, designers start with preset viewports, auto-scaling text, responsive type, predefined spacing values, and layout patterns that already behave intelligently.\n\nEngineers get Tailwind-compatible variables exported directly from the system. No translation. No pixel-counting. No “why doesn’t this match the design?” threads.\n\nWhen structure does the heavy lifting, teams spend less time fixing the basics and more time building things that actually matter.\n\n![A screenshot taken from Figma showing variables of text sizes, line heights, letter spacing, spacing scale](/uploads/blog/meet-olli-img-2.png)\n\n### 3. To support creativity, not restrict it\n\nSome design systems are loud - full of rules and rigid components that slowly reduce a team’s ability to think freely. Olli isn’t that.\n\nOlli is intentionally quiet.\n\nIt handles the underlying logic - typography scales, spacing systems, breakpoints, modes, variables, and stays out of the way everywhere else. It accelerates creation rather than narrowing what’s possible.\n\nYou can experiment, explore, and invent with Olli. You just do so on a foundation that keeps everything coherent, consistent, and buildable.\n\n### 4. To scale with us from day one\n\nStartups often end up rewriting their design foundations once the product grows. We chose to build ours early — not because it was glamorous, but because it was necessary.\n\nOlli lets us scale confidently. New features snap into place. New designers onboard faster. New products inherit the same principles.\n\nIt’s one system, many expressions.\n\n## How Olli works\n- **Tokens & Variables.** Figma Variables power the entire framework — spacing, colour, responsive typography, scales, motion. They enforce consistency without limiting creativity.\n- **Styles & Modes** Text styles dynamically adjust across breakpoints. Custom mode selectors let us shift typography systems or weights instantly. This makes multi-viewport design faster and far less error-prone.\n- **Tailwind Export.** Our variables map directly into Tailwind-friendly output. Today it’s a quick manual process; tomorrow it will be automated. Either way, it ensures engineering and design interpret the system the same way.\n\n## What it means for Datum\n\n- **Clearer, more coherent user experiences.** Users feel the harmony of a system even if they never see it.\n- **Faster design and engineering cycles.** Less negotiation, less translation, less friction.\n- **Space for creativity.** Structure gives us freedom - because it removes noise.\n- **A shared language across the company.** One foundation, one vocabulary, one way of building.\n\n## A quiet framework with a loud impact\n\nOlli won’t appear in our marketing. It won’t show up in onboarding. Users won’t ever know its name. But they’ll feel it - in the clarity of the interface, in the consistency of interactions, in the sense that everything simply _fits_ together.\n\nAnd for our team, Olli gives us the thing that’s hardest to get right: a way to move quickly without breaking coherence, and a way to maintain quality without slowing down.\n\nIt’s the quiet framework behind better user experiences and faster delivery.\nAnd it’s only the beginning."

          "body": "_Ninety days._\n\nThat’s how long it took us to stand up a global network for Datum this past summer. IP space, Anycast, DNS, routing policies, traffic engineering, observability—all of it. In just a few months, we had a purpose-built infrastructure running across providers like NetActuate and Vultr, delivering the kind of control and visibility usually reserved for well-established giants.\n\nOf course, this has literally been my job for 25 years, so I really should know what I’m doing! Plus, I had the help of Tom Daly (one of the foremost network builders in the world), the daily support of Josh Reese and Scot Schuchert-Wells (StackPath, SoftLayer alums) and friends in all the right places on speed dial. Or at least Slack connect and WhatsApp.\n\nTo put it another way: I had all the advantages, knew exactly what to do, was highly motivated, and still it took me months. All so that we could show up and participate on the internet at a meaningful level.\n\nIn most every way, deploying and managing scaled infrastructure is a solved problem. Between the cloud native revolution, the maturation of DevOps, and the long march of open source, it’s pretty standard practice to do what Supabase says on their website: _build in a weekend, scale to millions_.\n\nIt may not be a journey without trials and tribulations, but it is certainly more doable than ever — thanks in large part to an exploding class of [alt clouds](https://github.com/datum-cloud/awesome-alt-clouds) like Supabase plus also Modal, AuthZed, Metronome, Daytona, Turso, Vercel, and so many others.\n\nUnfortunately, as my recent “around the internet in 90 days” adventure proved, it’s a radically different journey to innovate on the foundations of the internet.\n\n## Why this, and why now?\nToday we announced $13.6M in seed funding from a truly amazing group of investors, including Sunil at [Amplify](https://www.amplifypartners.com/), Reid at [CRV](https://www.crv.com/), Alex at [Encoded](https://encoded.vc/), Zoe at [ex/ante](https://www.buildexante.com/), Will at [Step Function](https://www.stepfunction.vc/) and the entire team [Vine](https://vineventures.com/).\n\nHere was our pitch: \n\n> We want to help 1k new clouds thrive in the AI era.\n\n> But with workload and data being distributed everywhere, regulation becoming more complex (the “splinternet” is real), and security concerns skyrocketing, an entire generation of cloud and AI-native builders is working with at least one hand tied behind their backs.\n\n> What if we could give them access to the same capabilities that the big guys use today (e.g. authoritative DNS, distributed edge proxies, global backbones, deterministic routing, cloud on-ramps, and private connections), but in the tools they already use, like Cursor and Kubernetes? \n\n> What if we could unlock internet superpowers for every builder?\n\nDatum is working to crack open this world and invite the next generation to get their hands dirty — no network team or months-long build required. Frankly, we need their help to build and run the next chapter of the internet — one where thousands of clouds, millions of builders, and billions of agents can interact securely.\n\nJust like the peering forums and NANOG meetings of yesterday, we’re anxious to show up, collaborate, and invest in this community.\n\nIf you’re interested in seeing how you can be involved (or to give us feedback) [please reach out](/contact/)."

          "body": "On June 12, 2008, I had cuts on my fingers from cage nuts, the local pubs had closed for the night, and I was exhausted from a long day racking, stacking, and cabling at the Equinix AM2 datacenter in Amsterdam, Netherlands. We were proud of our work: a perfect rack layout, swirls of cabling designed to eliminate stress on connectors, and plenty of room for future expansion. This point of presence (POP) would be one of 15x deployed to build the DynECT Managed DNS global network.\n\nIn my role as co-founder and CTO at Dynamic Network Services ([DynDNS.org](http://DynDNS.org)), I was sometimes able to get out into the field to help deploy new infrastructure. Getting into the datacenter is a chance to connect a virtual world to the physical world - concrete floors, tilt up slabs, plumbing, power, cooling, and of course, fiber optics. For me, that time in the datacenter is a welcome relief from the desk jockeying that precedes in bringing a new POP online.\n\n![A rack filled with dozen servers](/uploads/blog/from-cage-nuts-to-kubernetes-img-1.jpg)\n\nAs experienced infrastructure operators can attest, racking, stacking, and cabling a POP is often the culmination of many months of effort - there is a ton of work that starts long before anyone can get past the datacenter’s guard desk. There are so many tasks to get done before a piece of gear can ever land in a POP:\n- Site Selection: Where, why, and how will you deploy?\n- Physical Site Evaluation: Physical Security, Building and Power Systems Resilience\n- Connectivity: Fiber, Transport, Transit, Fabrics, Peering Exchanges, Out of Band\n- Certifications: SOC-2 Type 2, ISO27001, PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc\n- Master Service Agreements, Statements of Work, Service Level Agreements, etc.\n- Hardware Procurement, Shipping, Importation, Logistics, and Insurance\n- Datacenter Procedures: Physical Access, Ordering Cross Connects, Accessing Remote Hands\n\n![Piled boxes of network tools inside office](/uploads/blog/from-cage-nuts-to-kubernetes-img-2.jpg)\n\nThese steps, this toil, this paperwork - well, it is commonly months of effort to complete. Master Service Agreement negotiations often involve representatives from technical, business, legal, and procurement teams. Evaluation of a connectivity partner requires technical due diligence, network surveillance, and proof of concept deployments. Shipping equipment across international borders requires new business entities for importation, payment of duties, and tax management strategies. For worldwide networks like DynECT, this isn’t “just a rack of gear” - it is a massive commitment in capital expenditures and future operating expenditures.\n\nRacking and stacking the gear is only one part of the puzzle. That was the part we figured out how to turn into a mini factory assembly line. When you are building a globally anycast IPv4 / IPv6 dual stack network, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of small one off tasks that need to be performed:\n\n- Autonomous System Number (ASN) acquisition from a Regional Internet Registry (RIR)\n- IPv4 Address Space acquisition from one or more RIRs.\n- IPv6 Address Space acquisition from one or more RIRs.\n- Internet Routing Registry (IRRdb) database entries.\n- IP Address Geolocation Updates in a dozen or so various registries\n- RPKI ROA setup and deployment (Not in 2008, but certainly in 2025)\n- Domain Registration and Nameserver Glue Record Creation\n\nThe list goes on and on and on. Every time a global network is deployed, someone is doing this work.\n\n![A screenshot of Routing Security Dashboard. A table showing eligibility of Internet Routing Registry (IRR) and Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).](/uploads/blog/from-cage-nuts-to-kubernetes-img-3.jpg)\n\nLast I checked, there was no Ansible Playbook for setting up BGP RPKI ROAs at an RIR. There is no Terraform script for generating IRRdb records. And there is no Kubernetes Operator for managing Nameserver Glue Records. _Or is there - hint hint hint?_\n\nLet’s fast forward this story to December 2024 — when my phone buzzed with a call from a longtime friend, Alex Benik from Encoded VC. Alex is the kind of person who doesn’t call just to chat. His calls come with a gravitational pull — if he’s dialing, something interesting is happening somewhere on Earth.\n\n“Tom,” he said, after the usual two-second pleasantries, “you’re not going to believe what Zac and Jacob Smith are up to.”\n\nNow, I’ve known Zac and Jacob for almost as long as I’ve known what a cage nut is. The brothers behind Packet (later acquired by Equinix) have always had a unique trait: the uncanny ability to look at a deeply unglamorous infrastructure problem and somehow turn it into a party everyone wants to attend. “More in the tent,” as Jacob would say.\n\nAlex continued. “They’re building something new. And… well… it’s exactly the kind of thing you’ve been doing on repeat for about twenty years.”\n\nI paused. “Which part? The RIR paperwork? IP geolocation purgatory? IRRdbs that still feel like they’re running on email templates? Or the fact that deploying a global network still feels like assembling Ikea furniture from memory while blindfolded in a freezing data hall?”\n\n“Exactly,” he said. “All of it. You know, the work no one brags about on LinkedIn. Except maybe you.”\n\nThis is the work you _absolutely must do_ if you want your packets to reach their destinations, and your customers to think your network just “magically” works.\n\nAlex went on:\n\n“They’re calling it… well, they’re still deciding. But imagine if all the things you listed — the RIR tickets, the ROAs, the IRR entries, the IPAM, the glue records, the compliance artifacts, the datacenter onboarding forms — imagine if that all became programmatic. Declarative. Automated. Version-controlled.”\n\n“And cross-cloud?” I asked.\n\n“Cross-cloud, cross-colo, cross-everything.”\n\n> There is an astonishing amount of manual, repetitive, institutional tribal knowledge that sits beneath every modern distributed system. A web of fragile and undocumented playbook of steps that every engineer inherits and quietly re-implements for the hundredth time.\n\nHearing Alex describe Zac and Jacob’s new venture felt like someone saying, “Hey, you know that burden you’ve been carrying your entire career? The one you assumed was part of the deal? Yeah… you can put it down now.”\n\nAnd that’s where the story picks up — the collision between two decades of muscle memory and a new idea that infrastructure deployment doesn’t have to feel like a pilgrimage with a screwdriver and a stack of NDAs.\n\nFor reference, Amazon EC2 became Generally Available in 2008. Amazon has done this work too. And so has Google Cloud, Oracle, Verisign, UltraDNS, ISC, Packet Clearing House, and every other major cloud provider, bare metal provider, DNS host, and content delivery network (CDN) - _yeah, I built one of those too - did the same work_.\n\nEven as virtual machines became APIs and entire data centers dissolved behind glossy cloud consoles, this part of the job never actually changed. The servers moved, the buttons moved, but the bureaucracy and the tribal knowledge stayed stubbornly physical. And so did the network.\n\nNo one does this toil-filled (paper) work anymore, but here is the big trade off - as developers and engineers, we are constantly being abstracted away from driving the network like the super power tool it is! The network, as we’ve seen, is often the moat.\n\nThe Cloud changed the game. We got a new level of abstraction with robust APIs that automated many elements of the infrastructure layer. New tooling and patterns have evolved to help developers manage infrastructure like they manage code - with semantic versioning, idempotent runbooks, and even AI assisted CLIs. But again, the network is often guarded, protected, and cordoned off from your enjoyment.\n\nClouds automated everything except the connective tissue that binds systems together. We gained infinite compute, ephemeral storage, GitOps, and AI-assisted CLIs — yet the networking fundamentals remained locked behind vendor portals, NDAs, and tribal knowledge.\n\nThe world of AI will rely on networks like we’ve never seen before. When connectivity is a barrier, or abstracted away from maximum leverage, innovation slows. No one has time for this anymore. In reality, less and less people know how to execute these awkward, arcane, and legacy steps in our industry.\n\nDatum is working to take these complex, long-lived, learned experiences of network operators and developers into a systematic platform driven by the modern Kubernetes ecosystem.\n\n- Want a front door for your website or ecommerce shop?\n- Need to create secure app to app connections among or between clouds?\n- Want a logical VLAN or physical cross connect so you can move your data efficiently?\n- Want to enjoy these capabilities but with full control over the network riding underneath it?\n\nDatum’s goal is simple: take the messy, arcane playbooks of Internet infrastructure and turn them into programmable, declarative, repeatable primitives — the same way Kubernetes did for distributed compute - but for networks. Datum distills years of toil and experience in Internet engineering so everyone in the AI generation can enjoy the feeling of running on a powerful network they fully control.\n\n![A screenshot showing table of domain names as K8s resource definition in Datum system](/uploads/blog/from-cage-nuts-to-kubernetes-img-4.jpg)\n\nDatum isn’t going at this effort alone. Datum has recruited a powerful community of modern infrastructure providers to power their network. These infrastructure providers are best in class at hosting, advanced BGP routing, and transit connectivity. They have exposed APIs to automate provisioning, configuration management, and deployment. Datum is layering on those stacks to deliver the “networking creature comforts” that we’ve all missed when operating in the Cloud.\n\nDatum turned up AS33438 in less than 60 days in 12 cities globally while performing the tedious steps above — the same steps that used to take quarters of planning and operators with decades of scars. And now it's automated, routine, and repeatable. And available to everyone “in the tent” by API.\n\nAt DynDNS, we knew what we were building: core Internet infrastructure (compute, storage, and network) that just could not go down. We enjoyed direct and hands-on access to the network that allowed us to deliver a superior product offering. We had our networking superpowers in hand.\n\nAt Datum, the team has a vision to bring these networking superpowers to the next wave of builders. No networking team required."

          "body": "For two decades, we’ve built applications on the internet the hard way, taking our apps to the network. You build something cool, then schlep it to a cloud provider, configure security, set up infrastructure, pray nothing breaks, and hope you didn’t miss a vulnerability or obscure setting. It’s like moving your entire house closer to the post office instead of just getting mail delivery.\n\nDatum MCP flips this model on its head and brings the network to your application, right where Cursor and Claude are already helping you build it.\n\n## A Brief History of “Please Come to the Network”\nLet’s rewind. In the telecom world, connectivity between two points usually means physical wires dug into the ground or cross connects between routers in a datacenter: literally plugging one network port into another. Powerful, but expensive and slow.\n\nThe dot com era brought Ethernet over MPLS, which was… still expensive and slow (and actually pretty complicated to maintain). Although this new Internet Age offered a cheaper, faster alternative vs dragging all users and networks back to your corporate office, you still had to get your app onto the internet, which required:\n* Hosting providers (to host your servers)\n* Cloud providers (to scale those servers)\n* Platform-as-a-Service, Database-as-a-Service, and every-other-thing-as-a-Service to make it run\n\nFast forward to 2025 and we’re swimming in clouds: hyperscalers, alt-clouds, neo-clouds - you name it! Trying to orchestrate them all while building apps with the latest AI assisted IDE’s like Cursor can be a bit of a mess. How do you connect everything without becoming a networking expert or selling a kidney to pay for infrastructure and tokens?\n\nDatum MCP isn’t the answer to all your problems, but we have a hunch it will change the way you build and ship by bringing more of the internet to your app, instead of always forcing your app to go to the internet.\n\n## Cursor as Conductor, Datum as the Orchestra\nThe [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is exploding in popularity, letting AI agents access data, SaaS apps, and tools directly from the prompt window. Datum MCP plugs into this ecosystem, working alongside your other MCP tools, such as Vercel for app deployment, Supabase for databases, Grafana for observability etc.\n\nHere’s the magic: Datum MCP helps you tap into internet superpowers like DNS, domain management, an Envoy-based global proxy and built-in WAF protection right from that Cursor window. No separate portals. No context switching. Just prompts.\n\n## What’s in the Box\nHere’s what our initial release of Datum MCP can do:\n* Domains & DNS - Access your domain inventory and configure authoritative DNS zones without leaving Cursor. \n* Global Front Door - Use Datum’s global Anycast edge to interact with users globally, while keeping your local environment safe. Your app stays on your Mac, Windows, or Linux machine; the internet comes to you.\n* Security & Protection - Configure Datum’s 1-Click WAF to implement industry standard OWASP protection rules, get real-time threat intelligence, and protect against DDoS—all from the same chat window where you’re building your app.\n* Authentication & Authorization - OAUTH2.1 flows for Datum tool calling (for example rate-limiting to origin/upstream application server) configured conversationally with Claude.\n* Observability - OpenTelemetry (OTel) exported directly to Grafana Cloud and configurable with Grafana MCP. Understand where traffic comes from and how users behave, then adapt accordingly.\n\n## From Prompt to Production?\nLet’s paint a picture. You’re iterating fast in Cursor. Your app is running locally. Traditionally, testing with friends means deploying somewhere, configuring DNS, setting up SSL certificates… ugh.\n\nWith Datum MCP, it’s different: “Cursor, give my app a public URL with basic auth for testing.” Done. Your app stays local; the network finds it.\n\nMaybe you’re ready to let some beta users or colleagues in? “Cursor, add rate limiting and restrict access to this list of email addresses.” Your local development environment now has enterprise-grade access control.\n\nTime to go further: “Cursor, remove access restrictions, enable standard WAF rules, and be sure to send telemetry to my Grafana Cloud account.” You’re globally distributed and protected, all while your app still runs on your laptop, \n\nThe secret? Nobody on the internet knows where your app actually lives. They knock on Datum’s front door; Datum proxies traffic securely to your local machine or cloud environment. \n\n## Why This Matters\nThe cross connect has evolved. It’s no longer about physically plugging cables in a datacenter. It’s about Cursor or Claude understanding your goals via natural language and open, programmable platforms like Datum making it happen: securely, globally, instantly.\n\nWhile there is still plenty of work to do and problems to solve, we think this is a real unlock for builders, helping them orchestrate the internet without leaving their laptops. \n\nThe network comes to you, finally! No networking team required."

          "__component": "shared.rich-text",
          "body": "When starting Datum, I knew the business should be as open as possible. \n\nTo a large degree that was driven by instinct, plus a strong affinity for the open source ethos that transformed the internet and defined my career over the last two decades. \n\nEven more important is the idea of trust — how to gain it and how to keep it efficiently. Here's how that led us to adopt an AGPL-3.0 license for our core technology. \n\n## Always start with the \"why\"\n\nSome people love noodling on technical problems or organizing product roadmaps and customer features. Me? I love thinking about big, ten-year cycles at the intersection of business, society, and technology. That's my jam!\n\nOn any given day I meet with 5-10 people, seeking to expand and calibrate my worldview and sense of the market. Over time — usually with the assistance of very long walks around Lower Manhattan and some killer playlists — I try to synthesize what I've learned and formulate an answer to an ever present set of related questions: \n\n*   What in our world needs to exist or work differently? \n*   What are the ingredients to make it possible?  \n*   How could we get there?\n*   Can I help?\n\nI've been chewing on the same general problem set for a while now, which is how to help ambitious companies \"play to win\" in a technology-led world. This is predicated on a belief that technology innovation is a critical ingredient in solving the world's pressing problems, and that more opinions at the table is better. It's what led me to start Packet, and why I'm back in the game today.\n\nOver the last year I've determined that the top tech-led companies need a neutral operating partner to help connect them with their unique ecosystem (customers, partners, providers). This platform needs to be software led and provide value that can be used anywhere. \n\nFinally, it needs to enable a wide array of incumbent and new specialty providers, from network and security vendors to the emerging crop of AI startups, verticalized SaaS solutions and new consumer experiences. \n\nEnds up, that's a lot of surface area to support. Which makes gaining and keeping trust with extremely demanding customers a critical priority. Cue our open source strategy.  🙂\n\n## Lowering the Cost of Trust\n\nSo how do you gain trust with enterprise customers, fast-scaling startups, and incumbent providers all at once while remaining lean and nimble? This is a particularly thorny question when providing fundamental infrastructure that simply _has_ to work – entire businesses depend on it!  \n\nWhile it's a tricky needle to thread, it is way more possible when the underlying technology is built in the open and available under a clear, permissive license. In its best implementations, the commercial open source (COSS) approach allows customers to poke and prod at the tech, contribute features, influence roadmap, run it where they need to, and fork it if needs diverge!  \n\nAs an early partner to Joseph Jacks at [OSS Capital](https://oss.capital/) and many other open source startups, I've seen how much of a \"nitro\" effect this can be for small teams gaining trust with big ideas. \n\n## Value creation over value capture\n\nAnother thing I love about COSS business models is that it allows teams to spend more resources investing in value creation (product/service) and less on GTM (value capture), especially during the early stages. \n\nThe idea is simple: spend your time shipping features, getting engagement, and encouraging adoption instead of selling folks on subscriptions, services or contracts. Granted, commercial friction can be reduced in other ways — such as generous free tiers in the SaaS world — but can also be quite expensive for infrastructure focused businesses. Plus, we recognize that there is no way for Datum to be \"everywhere\" our customers might need our value.\n\nFor clarity, I'm a huge believer in sales, which is the hardest job at any company. Open source doesn't relieve a company of building a world-class go-to-market capability, but I do believe it opens up a lot of fertile ground at a low cost.\n\n## No really, use it anywhere\n\nIn the first era of the Internet and then Cloud, most innovation happened in a few centralized locations. Think US-EAST (Ashburn, VA), Silicon Valley, Amsterdam, Singapore, etc.  \n\nThese hubs grew as the result of a network effect (literally cables and wires!) that allowed companies to access the vast majority of the internet by showing up in a few of the right datacenters. \n\nThis has changed dramatically over the past decade. \n\nFirst off, the Internet and Cloud ecosystem has grown, with AWS alone boasting over 100 Availability Zones in 30+ countries. Formerly far-flung \"tier 3\" cities are now robust hubs of connectivity, including streaming, application hosting, security and traffic analysis. Retail outlets have their own mini \"datacenters\" with even worn-torn Ukraine featuring a chain of convenience stores that runs thousands of independent Kubernetes clusters to power their point of sale, security and front office systems.  Being able to offer the same experience to federated, private or 3rd party clouds and datacenters as one would in a central managed cloud experience is just as critical to the economics of the Datum business as it is to the use cases and technical requirements of today's distributed applications.\n\nAnd then there is the developer workflow – builds, dev environments and more happen on MacBooks everywhere. But those pesky VPC's, network ecosystems, global WAFs, load balancers and other required components that connect each and every application to other services and networks are somehow not normally part of that software stack workflow.\n\nAs we considered these changes and how to deliver on our promise of \"connectivity infrastructure to power your unique advantage\", I knew we had to ship a lot of our value literally everywhere. While this could be done via closed source binaries, I think it makes the most sense to enable our users and future customers, partners and contributors to do su under a permissive open source license. \n\nIt's how I would want it, and I think it's how most software builders — who are looking to build repeatable, scalable products and experience — would feel empowered to jump in with both feet.\n\n## So, about the money!\n\nIf \"open\" is a good way to earn trust, find product fit, and get traction with users then how and when do we make money?\n\nI've watched many of my friends, former colleagues, and mentors grow businesses over the last few years: Alexis at Datadog, Spencer at CockroachDB, Kris at NS1 and now NetBox Labs, Avi at Kentik, and so many others. \n\nHowever, the one I'm most intimate with is Grafana Labs. Raj and much of the founding team at Grafana were partners at Voxel (the first startup I helped build back in the early 2000's), and I think their early focus and clarity on how they planned to make money has been key to their success. While Grafana is open source and zillions of people download and use it without ever paying a dime, Grafana Labs has a thriving revenue engine built squarely around Grafana Cloud (metrics and logs storage) and enterprise licensing, including on the major public clouds, in private datacenters and even more far flungs places. \n\nI think this clarity and consistency has made all the difference. We've all seen examples where thriving open source projects evolved to embrace a business reality, which can be disruptive and hard to swallow. I believe that Datum can start with those lessons in mind. \n\nWhile we don't have all the answers yet, we expect to make money in three ways:\n\n1.  Running a cloud control plane, operational tools and other integrated software for customers\n2.  Renting customers network, compute, and storage capacity (infrastructure) \n3.  Making and maintaining private connections\n\n## Choosing the AGPLv3 path\n\nWith all of this in mind, the [GNU Affero General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) (AGPLv3) was an obvious choice for Datum. Unlike other licenses, AGPLv3 ensures that even if our software is accessed over a network (e.g. cloud services), any modifications made must also be shared with the community.\n\nThis \"network copyleft\" provision ensures that work remains open and that direct competitors to the Datum business model can't use our software as the basis for proprietary solutions without contributing back. Companies like [Grafana Labs have adopted AGPLv3](https://grafana.com/licensing/) successfully, striking a balance between openness and developing a sustainable revenue engine. \n\nOne of things I love about adopting AGPLv3 from the beginning is that it draws a line in the sand that encourages the right conversations, and helps folks calibrate their investment with our business model in mind. We want lots of companies to run Datum's technology anywhere they need to, and expect to be very flexible with our software to ensure that happens. But if you want to develop a direct competitor to our core service, we'll prefer you develop your own technology or community (or work with us to figure out the right contract!) instead of building on ours. \n\nMake sense? I hope so, but feedback is certainly welcome."

We often joked that Packet was an awesome global network with mildly interesting bare metal servers attached. This was further reinforced when Equinix — the global interconnection giant disguised as a colocation provider — acquired Packet in 2020.\n\nAfter integrating the Packet team and platform into Equinix, we took some time off to recharge and look for new ways to make an impact. It didn't take long for us to circle back around the lowest layers of [the OSI model](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/) and how they might unlock advantages for the companies playing to win. Since then we've developed a hunch into a thesis, and started to build the team, community and technology to move it forward.\n\nHere's what led us back into the game. Or to badly paraphrase the [political strategist James Carville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_the_economy,_stupid): it's the network, stupid!\n\n## Network and data intensive workloads are on the rise\n\nWe believe that a new crop of workloads — mainly driven by an explosion in the volume and value of data, intelligence, and AI — will shine a spotlight on how the biggest businesses connect with their customers, partners, and other providers. To be successful, we think these customers need a full range of network superpowers that can run anywhere, and a global platform where they can programmatically interact with their unique ecosystem.  \n\nHistorically, if you cared a lot about network workloads (trading, banking, payments, telecom, cloud services, gaming, media, data heavy SaaS) you built your own network. In addition to hooking up your private datacenters, factories, and offices, you'd create points of presence in strategic exchange hubs to connect with the internet at large, as well as other private networks, clouds and partners. \n\nWhile it comes with a fair bit of complexity, controlling your network destiny at these lower layers helps you tune a bunch of knobs around performance, cost, privacy, compliance, etc. For example, you can keep much of traffic off the public internet, be opinionated about how things are routed, and dial in your price vs performance ratios to match business requirements. \n\nOf course, with great power comes great responsibility, and this kind of work is the domain of a shrinking group of experts that are hard to hire and retain. Unlike cloud computing, where access to programmatic infrastructure created a universe of tooling to operate efficiently at scale, most software-minded people don't have access to the lowest layers of networking for the reasons outlined above.\n\nThat's why in a world where you can create thousands of [disposable dev environments](https://openhands.daytona.io/) for AI agents or [millions of SQLite databases](https://turso.tech/blog/a-deep-look-into-our-new-massive-multitenant-architecture) for each user session, it still takes an hour to boot up and configure a router and weeks to privately connect with a partner. \n\nDespite huge potential advantages, it's no wonder that even the most network-sensitive companies born in the last decade (globally distributed data platforms, looking at you!) don't dare to build their own.\n\n## It's a crazy world, we just scale in it!\n\nWith the gravity around public clouds, -aaS everything, global customer experiences, and a localized / fragmented regulatory environment, things are getting exponentially more complex. \n\nIf you're a fast-growing, tech-enabled business, tell us if this sounds about right:\n\n*   You've got workload on basically every cloud, plus private\n*   You've got a ton of data, its growing fast, and creating gravity\n*   You're working with a lot of technology partners, from Anthropic to Cisco\n*   You're tied into a sprawling range of online SaaS ecosystems\n*   You're looking at more regulation and localized control in your future, not less\n\nEven with public and private cloud solutions from the best providers and a killer team, you're on track to be a service provider to yourself and your customers, balancing all of the predictable competing priorities around performance, cost, security, and control. And a bunch of the levers you might want to pull on live in the networking stack. \n\n## Why create something new?\n\nOkay - say you agree that a network and data centric world is coming, and that there are real advantages available with low level superpowers. Why create something new? Why not just lean into existing services and make the best of it? \n\nLeveraging existing solutions is a reasonable argument for most companies, but we think the top few thousand technology producers, providers, and consumers need something that isn't currently available or on the horizon. \n\nThe most obvious answer is to turn to CDN's like Akamai, Fastly, and Cloudflare. Their networks were designed to cache content and deliver traffic at truly massive scale, with a clear value proposition: put their distributed multi-tenant network in front of your stuff, and it will get better / faster / cheaper and also more resilient. \n\nThis benefit holds true for most users with common use cases — like fronting the API for a popular SaaS app, accelerating a news website with millions of views while protecting it from DDoS attacks, and serving up content close to global users. But if you're in the business of delivering experiences at market-leading scale (Netflix in streaming, Apple with Relay, Facebook with ads, Roblox with game server matching, VISA with payments, Amazon with eCommerce) you build a lot of this yourself in order to balance factors like control, cost, performance, security, etc. \n\nIn response to demand, both Cloudflare (with Workers, R2, and containers) and Akamai (with Linode) have invited more workloads to sit alongside their networks. This is the right idea for many customers, but for market leaders, we see challenges that are at odds with their needs: \n\n1.  You can't take the Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly experience and plop it in another cloud, let alone your own datacenter, warehouse, or wind farm.\n\n2.  You can't run a Cisco 8kv router (or Palo Alto firewall) let alone tap into the complex Cisco ELA you worked so hard to negotiate.\n\n3.  While Cloudflare has a solid cloud onramp product, there isn't a button or API call to help you connect directly with Snowflake in Sao Paulo, Deutsche Telekom in Frankfurt, or Nasdaq in Secaucus. \n\nTo leverage these ingredients you'll still need to grab racks at a dozen Equinix, Digital Realty, or DataBank datacenters, roll your own gear, and build a network the old fashioned way.\n\nAnd this is exactly where Datum wants to innovate, by providing a network cloud that is optimized to run network workloads anywhere; that supports the commercial and technical experience of partner technologies from the start; and that reimagines how folks can privately connect with their customers, partners and providers.\n\n## What does a network cloud look like?\n\nDespite our opinions about control, even power users don't want to build and run everything themselves. Instead, they want a global cloud service designed around their needs that also works wherever they gosh-darn need it to. This is the promise of a modern cloud experience. \n\nTo make it happen, we are building an experience for connectivity infrastructure that prioritizes the following ingredients: \n\n*   **Open Source Stack** - Building in the open with an appropriately [permissive AGPL license](/blog/open-source-strategy/) helps us gain trust more quickly for a foundational layer of the stack, invites collaboration and enables liberal use of the stack outside of a 3rd party operator. Importantly, it also provides long-term protection for customers. If we fold or have divergent interests, you can always fork it.\n\n*   **Software is the User** - It's true that many tasks related to networks are physical and take time, but so does shipping a MacBook from Shenzhen to Des Moines. We think it's a good moment to imagine and create new ways to access that value, and it starts with making everything programmatic.**‍**\n*   **Federation** **from the Start** - We think you should be able to run network cloud workloads wherever you need to, including on our scaled, shared infrastructure but also on other clouds and in your private environments. That's why we're baking in federation as a core concept, so you can get a lot of the creature comforts of a cloud service even when you need to run the workloads somewhere else. **‍**\n*   **Partner Focused** - If we're going to invite customers to pursue their unique advantage, we need an ecosystem of providers to succeed. That's why we can't margin stack and fight with partners and their channels. We want to help them succeed with an aligned commercial and operational model from the start.\n*   ‍**Ecosystem all the Way** - Instead of making money by pushing more traffic, we aim to thrive by helping the biggest businesses gain advantage by connecting with their customers, partners, and providers more efficiently.\n\nAs you can probably tell, we're passionate about connecting others.
